- Clone the repository to an eclipse-workspace directory, then add the project by clicking 'File' -> 'Open Projects from File System' then selecting the folder 'GOL', then open main and click the larger 'Run' button in the toolbar
- Or download the individual files ('Main.java', 'Game.java', 'GridDisplay.java', and 'Controller.java') from the /src folder, and then when in the folder that the 4 files are in, in terminal type 'javac main.java' then 'java main'
